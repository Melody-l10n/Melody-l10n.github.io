Welcome to my portfolio website! Here I record and share some of my past experiences in the field of localization. With over 16 years of professional experience, I have worked across various tools and platforms, refining my skills in managing localization projects effectively. 

# About Me

I'm Melody, a seasoned localization expert with a rich background in managing multilingual content and ensuring high-quality project delivery. 

# Why here

I decided to create a personal website due to the company's geographical strategic adjustments this year, which led to the optimization of our entire team. During my job hunting, I realized that a resume alone doesn't fully capture the work Iâ€™ve done over the years. Through this process, I also discovered that creating a website could help document my experiences more effectively and perhaps provide valuable insights for others.
